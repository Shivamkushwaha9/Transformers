# Transformers
This repository contains implementations of the Transformer model architecture for machine translation tasks. The Transformer, introduced by Vaswani et al. (2017), is a state-of-the-art neural network architecture that has revolutionized the field of sequence-to-sequence modeling, including machine translation.
